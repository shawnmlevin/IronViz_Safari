## IronViz Safari Feeder contest

Attached is the dataset in my #IronViz Safari feeder.  The data was gathered entirely from wikipedia on June 14th 2017 (and will probably be out of date in the near future)

-I used this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_professional_sports_teams_in_the_United_States_and_Canada) as my starting point to gather team information.
-[This](ironviz2.xlsx) is the main file to compile all of the data
-To create the Sankey diagram, I had to densify the data using this [template](SankeyData.xlsx)
-The animal shapes can be found [here](shapes.zip)
